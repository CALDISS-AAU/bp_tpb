- Received labeled tweets from RA Eva B.
- Labels both as colour coded excel file or as tweets separated into several files
    - Note: The separate files is the correct version, as changed were made between colour coding and splitting into files (see below)
- From e-mail:
  - I started by colour coding the main Excel file like this:
  - Red - New Mobilities
  - Green - Blocked  mobilities
  - Blue - Physical  Stuckness
  - Orange - Surrounding  precarity and vulnerabilities
  - Yellow - Pandemic  precarity
    - Some tweets are not highlighted in any colours because I thought they were outside the scope of our research (i.e. they were about Search and Rescue operations in the Mediterranean, people drowning, civil society actions, EU policies that were not relevant for our focus and others) 
    - When I then created the new Excel files for each clusters and went through the tweets again, I refined and polished them, ***and moved some tweets from one cluster to the other (without going back to the main Excel document and changing colours)***. For instance, at the beginning I classified the topic of Syrian returns in different clusters (in the main Excel file) but in the end I moved all the tweets about Syrian returns in one thematic cluster (New mobilities). So this is just to say, that there are some minor differences between the colour-coding in the main Excel sheet and the tweets contained in the 5 different Excel sheets 
    - As regards the 5 Excel sheets for each thematic clusters, they are divided in sub-themes. You will see that some of them are highlighted, but this was just for me to recognise which tweets/articles were the most interesting ones.
