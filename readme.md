## Description

The COVID-19 pandemic and the politics of governing the “health crisis” have not only led to buttressing the authority of the state apparatus over the organization of communal life but also to the emergence of new forms of precarious mobility and immobility. COVID-19 devastated economies and the entrenchment of “hard borders” have spurred a paradoxical phenomenon in which immobilization has been interlaced with complex forms of displacement.

The purpose of the project is to set up a digital archive on "pandemic borderscapes", defined as highly conflictual and precarious environments in which individuals on the move have experienced entrapment, or displacement pressures to move onward.

The archive will consist of material from official Twitter news accounts, including tweets, articles, images, videos and so on. The project has a special emphasis on regions in the Middle east and North Africa. The material in the archive will be manually annotated according to relevant keywords for the material.

## Deliveries

CALDISS main delivery consists of providing the raw Twitter data from the Twitter API (via the full-archive search endpoint). This delivery consists of the following:

- Setting up API queries
- Extracting URLs to articles and media files
- Transforming data to appropriate format for archive



### Partial deliveries

CALDISS will set up an annotating tool for manually categorizing/labelling the data.

CALDISS agrees to do several Twitter API queries, if necessary, to make sure all relevant data has been collected.



### Project participant contribution

**Contributions from PI and student assistant/research assistant (Dept. of Politics and Society)**

- Providing parameters for API queries
- Annotating data
- Possible additional manual data collection



**Contributions from CLAAUDIA**

- Assisting in data tranformation and data cleaning
- Setting up preliminary analysis workflow, if relevant



## Follow-up meetings

Follow-up meetings will be held approx. every four weeks (4-5 meetings in total).
